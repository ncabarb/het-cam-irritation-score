# HET-CAM Irritation Score Calculator

Original methodology described by Luepke (1985).
Web-based calculator for the HET-CAM (Hen’s Egg Test – Chorioallantoic Membrane) irritation score.

This tool was developed to assist in the calculation and classification of irritation potential based on vascular reactions observed in the HET-CAM assay, following the methodology originally described by Luepke (1985).

## Method Overview

The HET-CAM assay evaluates irritation by monitoring the onset time (in seconds) of:
- Hemorrhage
- Vascular lysis
- Coagulation

The irritation score is calculated using a weighted formula and classified into irritation categories according to established thresholds.

## How to Use

1. Enter the observed onset times for hemorrhage, lysis, and coagulation.
2. The calculator automatically computes the irritation score.
3. The result is displayed along with its corresponding irritation classification.
